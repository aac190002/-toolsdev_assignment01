Amazon announces one-year ban on police use of facial recognition tech - Timothy B. Lee
Amazon is instituting a one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition, its facial recognition software, the company announced on Wednesday.
"We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology," Amazon wrote in its blog post announcing the change.
A few jurisdictions have taken steps to restrict the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.
The Bay Area has been a leader in this respect, with San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley all banning the use of facial recognition software by police.
The bill prohibits the application of facial recognition software to body camera footage without a warrant.

3M sues price-gougers who used Amazon to sell masks at 1,800% markup - Kate Cox
3M—which manufactures N95 filtration masks that have been in high demand since the COVID-19 pandemic began—is suing merchants who used Amazon to sell 3M and counterfeit masks for more than 18 times their standard price.
3M has drastically increased its production of N95 respirator masks, the company says, but has kept its pricing between $0.63 and $3.40 per mask, depending on the model.
eBay outright banned listings for masks, hand sanitizers, and disinfectant wipes in early March amid rampant price-gouging and potential fraud.
Amazon did not follow suit, instead turning to algorithmic detection and consumer complaints to remove problem listings.
More than 30 states' attorneys general late in March asked online retailers, including Amazon, to take stronger, more proactive action against price-gouging merchants.

“Culture of workplace fear” leads to COVID-19 spread at Amazon, suit says - Kate Cox
She requested paid quarantine leave from the company under the terms of New York law, the suit says, but Amazon failed to pay her.

A former Amazon employee, Christian Smalls, spoke out about the unsafe conditions at JFK8 back in March and organized an employee walkout in protest.
Amazon also fired several other employees who spoke out about working conditions in the company's warehouses amid the COVID-19 crisis.
The Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James in late April began an investigation into the health and safety practices at Amazon's New York warehouses.

Amazon Won’t Let Police Use Its Facial-Recognition Tech for One Year - Louise Matsakis, Louise Matsaki
Amazon announced on Wednesday it was implementing a “one-year moratorium” on police use of Rekognition, its facial-recognition technology.
Lawmakers and civil liberties groups have expressed growing alarm over the tool’s potential for misuse by law enforcement for years, particularly against communities of color.
In a short blog post about the decision, the tech giant said it hopes the pause “might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules” for the use of facial-recognition technology, which is largely unregulated in the US.
In addition to Rekognition, Amazon also owns Ring, a home security company that has entered into over a thousand secretive partnerships with local police departments.
“This surveillance technology’s threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year.
